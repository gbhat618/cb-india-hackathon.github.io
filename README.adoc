This application is built and deployed using the Github Pages features.
So it doesn't require any explict CI/CD integration.
Due to the naming of the project, Github automatically builds and deploys the app.

== Contributing

For making changes to the app, we prefer to follow the Fork + PR style, as that is the best practice.

== Testing in local

Having `docker` installed is the only requirement.

Make changes to the code and run it and see in http://localhost:4000
```bash
docker compose up
```

`CTRL + C` to stop
